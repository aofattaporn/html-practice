        "Biden is memorable for making gaffes and misspeaking," says Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a political analysis newsletter at the University of Virginia.

The pandemic meant Mr Biden adopted a lower profile - and the election became "just an up or down vote on Trump", rather than "a choice between two candidates".

However, Mr Coleman adds, the fact Republicans continued with traditional in-person campaigning also meant "Trump gained with non-white voters in rural areas where people may not have the best internet - where you need to go door to door to reach voters."

Finally, Prof Lichtman believes the pandemic also helped drive the highest voter turnout in more than a century. The pandemic "created a real sense of national emergencyâ€¦ I think that convinced American people - both pro-Trump and pro-Biden - that this election was the most critical event of their lifetime."


        It is important to know how the relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis is, if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything. This relationship - the coefficient of correlation - is called r. The r value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 means 100% related. Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values.
